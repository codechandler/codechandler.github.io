            “Most good programmers do programming not because they expect 
            to get paid or get adulation by the public, 
            but because it is fun to program.” -Linus Torvalds

            <h2> About me:  </h2> <p>&emsp;&emsp;Since my childhood I’ve had a growing hunger for the newest and greatest available, the tech of tomorrow. I have always loved solving problems, and I have the self-driving motivation to follow through whatever the cost. I do not give up easily. I’ve had many role models which have inspired me to dream big. A few examples are Steve Jobs, Alan Turing, and Elon Musk. These are men who were determined to change the world around them despite all odds. I will follow in their footsteps and make a difference. I have fallen in love with programming ever since I decided to pursue Computer Science here at Brigham Young University Idaho. There have been projects that stretched me to the maximum, and the problem churns in my head pursue a solution. I work into the early hours of the next day until I figure eventually figure it out and my mind can be put to rest. To some this might seem stressful, but I love it. The sense of accomplishment is next to none. I love working with others. Collaboration is a very fun and effective way to develop new skills. I’m looking for an internship that will give me exactly that! I’m two years from graduating but believe now is the time to put my skills to good use. I hope the rest of my Online Portfolio will adequately reflect who I am and what I want to become. </p>
